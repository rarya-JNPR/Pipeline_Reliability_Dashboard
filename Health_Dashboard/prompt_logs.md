```
Why you removed the date range and search box, column settings and filtering option from pipeline Runs? Make those as it is.
```

#### **AI Response:**
- Restored date range picker functionality
- Re-implemented search and filtering capabilities
- Restored column settings and sorting options
- Maintained Jenkins integration while preserving original features

#### **Key Learning:**
- Feature integration should be additive, not replacement

- Added Slack webhook integration
- Created real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- Added notification badge and dropdown UI

#### **Key Learning:**
- Real-time systems require multiple update mechanisms
- User experience drives technical complexity

---

### **5. Duplicate Notification Prevention**

#### **User Prompt:**
```
On the slack why we are getting too many duplicate notifications continuously. In the slack channel only the newly failed job alert should come.
```

#### **AI Response:**
- Added `notified` field to database schema
- Implemented notification tracking system
- Modified alert logic to prevent duplicates
- Added database session management

#### **Key Learning:**
- State management is crucial for notification systems
- Database schema evolution requires careful planning

---

### **6. URL Formatting Issues**

#### **User Prompt:**
```
On the slack we got http://jenkins:8080/job/Deploy%20AIagent/ url in place of http://localhost:8080/job/Deploy%20AIagent/18/. url should be http://localhost:8080/ and with build number.
```

#### **AI Response:**
- Fixed URL construction logic in sync processes
- Added build number to URLs
- Implemented URL transformation for notifications
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases

#### **Key Learning:**
- User expectations drive technical requirements
- URL formatting requires careful validation

## üõ†Ô∏è **Problem-Solving Sessions**

### **Docker Import Issues**

#### **Problem:**
```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "dayjs" from "src/pages/App.tsx"
```

#### **AI Solution:**
- Identified Docker caching as root cause
- Provided aggressive cache clearing commands
- Suggested `--no-cache` rebuild approach
- Explained Docker layer caching behavior

#### **Learning:**
- Docker caching can cause persistent import issues
- Container rebuilds require cache clearing

---

### **Jenkins API Authentication**

#### **Problem:**
```
403 No valid crumb was included in the request
```

#### **AI Solution:**
- Implemented CSRF crumb fetching
- Added proper authentication flow
- Created robust error handling
- Added logging for debugging

#### **Learning:**
- Jenkins API has specific security requirements
- Authentication flows require careful implementation

---

### **Database Schema Evolution**

#### **Problem:**
```
(sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: pipeline_runs.build_number
```

#### **AI Solution:**
- Provided manual ALTER TABLE commands
- Implemented defensive programming
- Added schema validation
- Created migration endpoints

#### **Learning:**
- SQLite schema changes require manual intervention
- Defensive programming prevents runtime errors
